# Nintendo-Radio

Nintendo Radio is a music player app that allows you to play, pause, and skip 10 different nintendo songs. I developed a better understanding of H-stacks, V-Stacks, and Z-Stacks when working on this project and also figured out how to convert music to .mp3, and allow that music to play whenever the play button was clicked. I also learned alot about customizing colors so that they weren't just the default colors that xcode allows. The first screenshot bellow shows how I did this.
